I've been tinkering with programming for decades now. Hacked some things together including a couple of web applications (Perl, later Meteor)...

As of mid-2018 I've decided to dive head-first into iOS and Swift, and do the work to "graduate" to being a "big-boy developer".

Planning to keep track of what I build and discover, including "gotchas" that I had to learn the hard way... 

At least that's the current plan. We'll see!
